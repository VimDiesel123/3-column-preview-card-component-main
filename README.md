## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was an easy challenge for me, which is a good sign because when I started I sucked!

I used CSS grid for the main card layout and changed the layout to be resonsive like this:

```css
.card {
  grid-auto-flow: column;
  max-width: 66%;
}
```

I'm pretty happy with that solution! I think it was clean and easy.
